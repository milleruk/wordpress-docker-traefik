# WPDC - WordPress Docker Compose

Easy WordPress development with Docker and Docker Compose.

With this project you can quickly run the following:

- [WordPress and WP CLI](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)

## Requirements

Make sure you have the latest versions of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.


Make sure to [add your user to the `docker` group](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) when using Linux.

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file to change the default IP address, MySQL root password and WordPress database name.

## Installation

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

This creates two new folders next to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

* `wp-data` – used to store and restore database dumps
* `wp-app` – the location of your WordPress application



For convenience you may add a new entry into your hosts file.

## Usage

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker-compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the`down` command:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

### Project from existing source

Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file into a new directory. In the directory you create two folders:

* `wp-data` – here you add the database dump
* `wp-app` – here you copy your existing WordPress code

You can now use the `up` command:

```
docker-compose up
```


### Creating database dumps

```
./export.sh
```

### Developing a Theme

Configure the volume to load the theme in the container in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```
volumes:
  - ./theme-name/trunk/:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/theme-name
```

### Developing a Plugin

Configure the volume to load the plugin in the container in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```
volumes:
  - ./plugin-name/trunk/:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name
```

### WP CLI

The docker compose configuration also provides a service for using the [WordPress CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).

Sample command to install WordPress:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli core install --url=http://localhost --title=test --admin_user=admin --admin_email=test@example.com
```

Or to list installed plugins:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli plugin list
```

For an easier usage you may consider adding an alias for the CLI:

```
alias wp="docker-compose run --rm wpcli"
```

This way you can use the CLI command above as follows:

```
wp plugin list
```
